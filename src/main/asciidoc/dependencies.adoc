[[dependencies.spring-boot]]
== Dependency management with Spring Boot

Spring Boot already selects a very recent version of Spring Data modules for you. In case you want to upgrade to a newer version nonetheless, simply configure the property `spring-data-releasetrain.version` to the <<dependencies.train-names,train name and iteration>> you'd like to use.

[[dependencies.spring-framework]]
== Spring Framework

The current version of Spring Data modules require Spring Framework in version {springVersion} or better. The modules might also work with an older bugfix version of that minor version. However, using the most recent version within that generation is highly recommended.
